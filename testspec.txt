Objective: To validate the generateSoundex function with multiple test cases that cover a variety of scenarios, including names with different consonants, vowels, special characters, and apostrophes, ensuring the function returns the correct 4-character Soundex code.

HandlesCommonName
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a common name with standard consonants.
Input: "Robert"
Expected Output: "R163"
Purpose: Ensure that a common name is correctly converted into its Soundex representation, including the appropriate translation of consonants into digits.

HandlesNameWithDifferentConsonants
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a name with different consonants across its letters.
Input: "Ashcraft"
Expected Output: "A261"
Purpose: Ensure that a name with a variety of consonants (non-repeated) is correctly converted, confirming that each consonant is mapped to its corresponding Soundex digit.

HandlesSingleCharacterName
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a single-character name.
Input: "A"
Expected Output: "A000"
Purpose: Ensure that a single character is handled properly by assigning it the correct initial letter and filling the rest with zeros.

HandlesNameStartingWithVowel
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a name that starts with a vowel.
Input: "Euler"
Expected Output: "E460"
Purpose: Ensure that names starting with a vowel are processed correctly, and that consonants following the vowel are converted as per the Soundex rules.

HandlesShortNameWithNoChanges
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a short name that should not change much due to its simplicity.
Input: "Lee"
Expected Output: "L000"
Purpose: Ensure that short names that donâ€™t contain complex consonant patterns are correctly filled with zeros after the first letter.

HandlesNameWithSpecialCharacter
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a name containing a special character.
Input: "B@rton"
Expected Output: "B635"
Purpose: Ensure that special characters such as @ are ignored and do not affect the conversion process of the name.

HandlesNameWithRepeatingLetters
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a name with repeating letters.
Input: "Addams"
Expected Output: "A352"
Purpose: Ensure that repeated letters are compressed into a single occurrence in the Soundex conversion.
